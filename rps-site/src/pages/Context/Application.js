        Data from EMG can be used in order to power upper extremity prosthetics for amputees without the need for hours of surgery, nor the invasive connections directly to the nervous system required.{'\n'}
        {'\n'}
        Current prosthetics are largely limited, especially when it comes to fine motor control like a hand, for example. The cheapest and most commonly found prosthetics are either passive or body-driven, with a few being externally powered by direct connections to the nervous system. While some myoelectric prosthetics are currently available on the market, they are distinctly limited to simple functions like opening and closing a hand as opposed to the original functions of the affected appendages.{'\n'}
        {'\n'}
        EMG data paired with current advances in neurotechnology has the potential to create upper extremity prosthetics that can provide high levels of precise functionality to amputees. This would increase the accessibility of daily life functions frequently taken for granted for many individuals.{'\n'}
